In the summer of 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, I embarked on a project to create a top-down shooter game prototype using Unity. The game's theme centered on the body's immune system, with the player controlling a leukocyte called Imuna that shoots and destroys invading microorganisms in human blood. The game featured two types of entities: first, easy-to-kill microbes that were stylized as spore-like nano-organisms; second, more complex organisms such as viruses and bacteria that appeared as heavier enemies and bosses in the game.
