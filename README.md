During summer of 2020 pandemic year overwhelmed by news related to viruses I decided to create a prototype of a top-down shooter game in Unity. In this project, Imuna is a white cell or leukocyte that shoots and destroys alien entities in human blood. My intention was to create two type of entities: first - easy to kill microbes and stylized spore like nano organisms; second - more complex organisms like viruses and bacteria that would appear as more heavier enemies and bosses in the game.
